# Welcome to my portfolio website!
I figured I should have some sort of CV/portfolio page out there for the world to see if I want to get hired for any work. 

# Fun features
- self-sorting skill list, based on selected field of interest. 
- self-sorting project detail tiles, based on selected field of interest. 
- hovering over tiles makes them zoom a little and overlays with a small 'headline' of text. 
- clicking on the tiles displays a larger (sometimes different) photo with more detailed text.
